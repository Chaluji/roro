# The Ruby on Rails Oceania (RORO) Meetup

## I want to submit or request a talk!

Awesome! :tada: Go check out the [issues page][] and submit your proposal
or request there!

## I want information about the current/next meetup!

Check out the [RORO Meetup page][] for all the latest info!

## I want information about past meetups!

The Meetup page should have the information you're looking for, otherwise go
check out the [wiki page][] and you should be able to find all the
information you need.

## I want to see the pretty meetup slide decks!

Feel free to clone this repo! The markdown in the slide decks can be used and
viewed in [Deckset][], or you can simply view the PDF versions of the slides.
