^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.<br />

Our first speaker of the evening is one a recent presenter from this years RubyConf, In 1977, NASA launched the Voyager probes into space. Each carried a copper ‘vinyl’ record, with music, speech… and 115 images, all inscribed on the disc as audio! In this talk we’ll pretend to be aliens; we’ll use Ruby to read the audio, recreate the images, and learn some space history too.

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention rorosyd to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] *Who's* **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **Hello!** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Roro can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* Exercism
# [fit] **Robot Name**

# [fit] *`exercism download --exercise=robot-name --track=ruby`*



^
When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name. </br>
The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.</br>
Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will respond with a new random name.</br>
The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence. Random names means a risk of collisions. Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

# [fit] *We are always looking for*
# [fit] **SPEAKERS!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We'd like to encourage anyone that's been sitting on the fence about speaking to look at submitting an issue for February's meetup
- There is nothing to lose and everything to gain from sharing ideas with your fellow rubyist.
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo has presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] *We are always looking for*
# [fit] **VENUES!**

^
These days we are also always looking for venues! If you or your company think you would like to give hosting a RORO meetup a shot, we would love to hear from you.<br />
There are no obligations, strings attached, or guilt-trips given about hosting RORO regularly, or even more than once.<br />
A one off is great and is appreciated, we'd also really love to find a permanent home for the next 6-12 months
If you've got a space big enough to host about 50-60 odd people, access to a projector, ability to have food delivered, maybe even a drinks fridge, and the desire to go down in the annuls of RORO Sydney as one of our awesome sponsors, then we should definitely talk.
We're looking for a December Venue and any month from March 2020, so if you want to host the final RORO of the year, please reach out to RORO organisers.
