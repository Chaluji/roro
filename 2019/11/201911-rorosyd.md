# [fit] **Code Of Conduct**

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.<br />

If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention rorosyd to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] *Who's* **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **Hello!** :wave:

So if you're new to Roro can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* Exercism
# [fit] **Meetup**

# [fit] *`exercism download --exercise=meetup --track=ruby`*

^
Next months challenge is Meetup. Calculate the date of meetups.<br />
Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week. In this exercise, you will take a description of a meetup date, and return the actual meetup date.<br />
Examples of general descriptions are:<br />
The first Monday of January 2017<br />
The third Tuesday of January 2017<br />
The last Thursday of January 2017<br />
Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and descriptor calculate the date of the actual meetup. For example, if given "The first Monday of January 2017", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/2.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

# [fit] *We are always looking for*
# [fit] **SPEAKERS!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

---

# [fit] **Where do I sign up?**

- :globe_with_meridians: *`github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`*
- *`@paulfioravanti`*
- *`@robcornish`*
- *`@matpushbuttons`*
- *:email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`*

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo has presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] *We are always looking for*
# [fit] **VENUES!**

^
These days we are also always looking for venues! If you or your company think you would like to give hosting a RORO meetup a shot, we would love to hear from you.<br />
There are no obligations, strings attached, or guilt-trips given about hosting RORO regularly, or even more than once.<br />
If you've got a space big enough to host about 50-60 odd people, access to a projector, ability to have food delivered, maybe even a drinks fridge, and the desire to go down in the annuls of RORO Sydney as one of our awesome sponsors, then we should definitely talk.
Whatever the case, if you are interested, please reach out to the RORO organisers.

This is a preview of the release we're expecting for Christmas this year. There are some cool new features planned for Ruby 2.7.

# [fit] **We're looking for**
## [fit] *HELP!*

^
Before we finish up tonight I wanted to put the word out that Mat, Paul and I are looking for help to keep RoRo going. 
</br>
We've been doing this for a couple of years now and feel it's time to step back a little and pass the reigns on to a new person or people that can continue to keep the RoRo flame burning. 
</br>
I can assure you it's a very rewarding endeavour and the friends you make and experience you gain is invaluable.
</br>
If you think you have what it takes, or even if you don't think you do, you probably do and don't even realise it. Come and speak to Paul or myself or reach out through one of the online channels and we can start the first stage of the 10 stage interview process beginning with a whiteboard exercise. No seriously, if you keen and passionate we'll probably just say, over to you.
