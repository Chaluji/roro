# [fit] **Code Of Conduct**

# [fit] **`conduct@ruby.org.au`**

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.<br />

RORO has many sponsors, without which these meetups would not be possible, so again a big thanks to Airtasker who are an online and mobile marketplace supporting the future of work. They kindly provide both the venue and drinks tonight.<br />

If you're twitter inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention rorosyd to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] **Who's New?**
# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Roro can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] Next Meetup's Exercism
# [fit] **_Phone Number_**

### [fit] `exercism download --exercise=phone-number --track=ruby`

^
This month's month's Exercism problem is Phone Number, which concerns a problem that pretty much all developers have to deal with: cleaning up user-entered data so we can use it within our system. In this case, you'll need to take strings that represent phone numbers, parse out extraneous characters like spaces, dashes, and brackets, leaving just the phone numbers themselves.<br />
As always you can find more details and download the challenge at the exercism.io and it you'd like to present your solution at next months meetup submit an issue on the RoRo github or contact myself or one of the other organisers.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

# [fit] **We are always looking for**
# [fit] SPEAKERS!

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

# [fit] **_Where do I sign up?_**

- :globe_with_meridians: `github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`
- _`@paulfioravanti`_
- _`@robcornish`_
- :email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo has presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] **The Ruby Toolbox**

After a period where the service feel into disrepair, the ruby toolbox has received significant investment of time from it's maintainer Christoph Olszowka thanks to the help of Ruby Together. Over the past year the new version of Ruby Toolbox has evolved with a user driven feature set and a completely new look.  For those that aren't aware of what the Ruby Toolbox does in their own words, 'is a catalog of all Rubygems that keeps track of popularity and health metrics to help you choose a reliable library.'

Heaven's Door: A tiny Rails engine that generates capybara test scenario by recording browser operation in development env. Akira Matsuda has created a whole bunch of great Ruby gems including Kaminari pagination and JB, the excellent JSON API templating engine, so this is likely to be worth looking into...and maybe doing a talk about...?

This isn't so much news as it is an interesting article to read. If you're working on a project that has reached the point of considering whether to forge ahead with the current code base or take a leap and rewrite then you might find comfort and food for thought in this article. The author Herb Caudill takes you though the obstacles faced by 6 large and well know products in making this decision highlighting the pros and cons of each. It might make you reconsider next time you reach for rails new.
