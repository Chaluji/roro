# [fit] **Code Of Conduct**

# [fit] **`conduct@ruby.org.au`**

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.<br />

If you're twitter inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention rorosyd to tie the night altogether.

# [fit] **Who's New?**
# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Roro can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] Next Meetup's Exercism
# [fit] **_Luhn_**

### [fit] `exercism download --exercise=luhn --track=ruby`

^
To kick the year off with challenges, this month we're going to work through creating the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. As always you can find more details and download the challenge at the exercism.io and it you'd like to present your solution at next months meetup submit an issue on the RoRo github or contact myself or one of the other organisers.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

# [fit] **We are always looking for**
# [fit] SPEAKERS!

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

# [fit] **_Where do I sign up?_**

- :globe_with_meridians: `github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`
- _`@paulfioravanti`_
- _`@robcornish`_
- :email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo has presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.
