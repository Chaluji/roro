Before we start, some of you may know that Rubyconf was on last week here in Sydney.<br />

We had a fantastic line up of speakers, including Sandi Metz, author of Practical Object Oriented Development Design in Ruby, and Paolo Perrotta, who ended up doing two presentations worth of machine learning talks.

And it was all in all an awesome community event.<br />
- Who here went to Rubyconf?
- Is there anyone on an extended visit to Sydney on the back of RubyConf? Welcome!

^
I think this tweet from Tom Ridge pretty much summed up many people's feelings about the event: I'm not sure what I expected, but I'm coming away from Rubyconf with a strong sense of feeling like I've had my community glass refilled.

# [fit] **_Code Of Conduct_**
# [fit] *`ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct`*
# [fit] *`ruby.org.au/committee-members`*

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul, Rob, and Andrew - or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.

# [fit] **_Thanks to our_** *Sponsors*
# [fit] ![inline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vlyd9d724nlk4ur/pivotal-logo.png?dl=1)

^
RORO has many sponsors, without which these meetups would be very bare bones, so<br />
Thanks to Pivotal, who've provided both our venue for tonight, and the drinks.<br />
Pivotal are a consultancy and also the makers of project management tool Pivotal Tracker.<br />
I think at least some of their clients have Ruby in their technical stack, and they're probably always hiring, so go talk to (?) to find out about any current positions.

That food budget is covered by Ruby Australia, and hence their sponsors are our sponsors, so we would like to thank...

# [fit] **_Who's New?_**
# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So, now if you're new to Roro, can you please put up your hand- don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you, we're going to have a 5 minute break so we can welcome them, and when we come back - we're going to have [speaker-name].

# [fit] **_Next Meetup's Exercism_**
# [fit] *Nucleotide Count* 
# [fit] `exercism fetch ruby nucleotide-count`

^
In this problem you are given a DNA string, and you need to compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string, which is a fancy science-way of saying count the number of times particular letters appear in strings, so this is a great problem for a junior developer and/or first time speaker<br />
So, if you haven't already, go and join the rorosyd Exercism team, take a crack at this problem, and then tell us all about how you solved it!

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

---

# [fit] **_We are looking for_**
# [fit] :loudspeaker: speakers!

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of a sympathetic audience that wants you to succeed, and is all very aware of the courage that it can take to deliver a talk in front of your peers.<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, you potentially get turned into an expert in your audience's eyes.<br />
- So if you've got something to say or cool to show and tell that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

# [fit] **_Where do I sign up?_**

- :globe_with_meridians: `github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`
- :email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`
- _`@paulfioravanti`_
- _`@robcornish`_
- _`@mootpointer`_

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo now also has 7 extra presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting to do more...(like Jenny)<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run with, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.
