If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are %{organiser names} - or you can go straight to Ruby Australia if you prefer.

Thanks to Pivotal, who've provided both our venue for tonight, and the drinks.<br />
Pivotal are a consultancy and also the makers of project management tool Pivotal Tracker.<br />
I think at least some of their clients have Ruby in their technical stack, and they're probably always hiring, so go talk to (?) to find out about any current positions.

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

# [fit] **_We are looking for_**
# [fit] :loudspeaker: **speakers!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of a sympathetic audience that wants you to succeed, and is all very aware of the courage that it can take to deliver a talk in front of your peers.<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, you potentially get turned into an expert in your audience's eyes.<br />
- So if you've got something to say or cool to show and tell that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...
