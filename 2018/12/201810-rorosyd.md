# [fit] **Code Of Conduct**

# [fit] **`ruby.org.au/committee-members`**
# [fit] **`conduct@ruby.org.au`**

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.<br />

RORO has many sponsors, without which these meetups would not be possible, so again a big thanks to Airtasker who are an online and mobile marketplace supporting the future of work. They kindly provide both the venue and drinks tonight.<br />

Ruby Australia, who organise sponsorship of all Ruby-related meet-ups around Australia make the delicious non-pizza dinner possible.<br />
That food budget is covered by Ruby Australia, and hence their sponsors are our sponsors, so we would like to thank...

^
If you're twitter inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention rorosyd to tie the night altogether. 

---

# [fit] **Who's New?**
# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Roro can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] Next Meetup's Exercism
# [fit] **_Flatten Array_**

### [fit] `exercism download --exercise=flatten-array --track=ruby`

^
The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil values. To complete it head over to exercism and download it using the command through the CLI. And if you'd like present your solution next month please let me know and submit an issue to the RoRo GitHub issues page.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

---

# [fit] **We are always looking for**
# [fit] SPEAKERS!

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

---

# [fit] **_Where do I sign up?_**

- :globe_with_meridians: `github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`
- _`@paulfioravanti`_
- _`@robcornish`_
- :email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo has presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] **NEWS**

---

# [fit] **Rails 5.2.2**
# [fit] **_Released_**

- https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v5.2.2

^
Rails 5.2.2 has been released. I was reading through the list and there are plenty of changes to keep you on your toes so take a read when you can.

---

# [fit] **Rails Updates**
# [fit] **_4.2.11 5.0.7.1 5.1.6.1 5.2.1.1_**

- https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/11/27/Rails-4-2-5-0-5-1-5-2-have-been-released/

^
Updates to these Rails versions have also been released. They can be found in the usual places according to the post along with the specifics at the GitHub repo. There is one noted security fix for Broken Access Control vulnerability in Active Job that should drive you to update. 


---

# [fit] **AWS Lambda**
# [fit] **now supports**
# [fit] **_RUBY_**

- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-ruby-support-for-aws-lambda/

^
This is really cool. Prior to now if Ruby was your preferred language you needed to get stuck into Python, Java or several other languages that were not Ruby if you wanted to use AWS lambda. Now you can create serverless functions using AWS in the comfort of your own Ruby encrusted office chair.

# [fit] **Stealth framework**
# [fit] **for** **_ChatBots_**

- https://hellostealth.org/
- https://github.com/hellostealth/stealth

^
This also looks really cool. Taken from their docs, Stealth is a Ruby based framework for creating voice & text chatbots. It's design is inspired by Ruby on Rails's philosophy of convention over configuration. It has an MVC architecture with the slight caveat that views are aptly named replies. I've been wanting to build a chatbot for work so this might be the time. If you already have experience with Stealth or plan on getting some over the festive season, there's a presentation request in the RoRo issues if you'd like to share with the rest of us.
