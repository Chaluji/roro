# [fit] **_Ruby on Rails_**
# [fit] **_Oceania_**
# *10 April 2018*

^
Welcome to Sydney RORO. Some of you might have noticed that something is a
little different this month. If you haven't yet, well we're at the fantastics
offices of Airtasker. Airtasker have taken on venue and drink sponsorship of our
meetup going forward. I'd like to take this chance to say a big thank you to Pivotal
who sponsored RoRo for the last 2 years but it's fantastic that Airtasker have
stepped up to help make RoRo, in my opinion, the best tech meetup around.

Again tonight we have a great lineup of speakers, we'll cover some upcoming

those with a sweeter tooth, gelato.

# [fit] *`ruby.org.au/committee-members`*

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul, Rob, and Andrew - or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.

RORO has many sponsors, without which these meetups would not be possible, so
again a big thanks to Airtasker, who've provided both our venue, and drinks
tonight.<br />

Ruby Australia, who organise sponsorship of all Ruby-related meet-ups around Australia make the delicious non-pizza dinner possible.<br />
That food budget is covered by Ruby Australia, and hence their sponsors are our sponsors, so we would like to thank...

# [fit] **_Next Meetup's Exercism_**
# [fit] *Rail Fence Cypher* 
# [fit] **OR**
# [fit] *Roman Numerals*

### `exercism fetch ruby roman-numerals || exercism fetch ruby rail-fence-cypher`

^
This month there are two options. Either the Rail Fence Cypher or Roman
Numerals. A Rail Fence Cypher is type of transposition cypher that gets it's name from the
way the message is encoded. The letters of the message are written downward on
successive rails of an imaginary fence, then move upward when they hit the
bottom forming a zig-zag pattern. The message is then read across the rows. This
is more challenging than some of the previous challenges we've set so
if you feel it's a little to much check out Roman Numerals where you need to
convert a normal number to it's Roman equivalent.  
So, if you haven't already, go and join the rorosyd Exercism team, take a crack at this problem, and then tell us all about how you solved it!

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

---

# [fit] **_We are looking for_**
# [fit] :loudspeaker: speakers!

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of a sympathetic audience that wants you to succeed, and is all very aware of the courage that it can take to deliver a talk in front of your peers.<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, you potentially get turned into an expert in your audience's eyes.<br />
- So if you've got something to say or cool to show and tell that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

# [fit] **_Where do I sign up?_**

- :globe_with_meridians: `github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`
- :email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`
- _`@paulfioravanti`_
- _`@robcornish`_
- _`@mootpointer`_

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo now also has 7 extra presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

if you up for some hacking or are looking for help from mentors sign up.<br />
