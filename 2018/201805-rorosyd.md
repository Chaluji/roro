# [fit] **_Code Of Conduct_**
# [fit] *`ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct`*
# [fit] *`ruby.org.au/committee-members`*

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul, Rob, and Andrew - or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.

So, now if you're new to Roro, can you please put up your hand- don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you, we're going to have a 5 minute break so we can welcome them, and when we come back - we're going to have Tian.

# [fit] **_Next Meetup's Exercism_**
# [fit] *Grade School* 

### `exercism fetch ruby grade-school`

^
This month, in celebration of the new school term starting, we're going back to Grade School, where given students' names along with the grade that they are in, you need to create a roster for the school. So, you should be able to:<br />
- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade<br />
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade<br />
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades<br />

That is your homework, so, if you haven't already, go and join the rorosyd Exercism team, take a crack at this problem, and then do a show and tell for us at the next meetup!

---

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and let's give them a round of applause for their efforts tonight!<br />
And if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

# [fit] **_We are looking for_**
# [fit] :loudspeaker: speakers!

We are looking for speakers!
[Show the issues list]
Month after month Rob and I have been making requests for speakers and you have responded with great enthusiasm, to the point where we now have a pipeline! I feel like some kind of ha ha business sales guy with prospects and clients now. So, the current state of our pipeline is:<br />
- 1 full length and 1 Exercism open for June<br />
- 1 full length and 1 Exercism open for July<br />
So, if you have anything you want to do a talk about, secure your position fast! Remember this meetup is nothing without you, our community, and the more people that give talks, the more diverse opinions and ideas we get exposure to, hence increasing the quantitative awesome levels of our community.<br />
- So if you've got something to say or cool to show and tell that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about, and especially if you are a first time speaker, then...
