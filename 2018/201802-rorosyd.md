# [fit] **Conduct**
- `ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct`

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read. If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are {list organisers} - or you can go straight to Ruby Australia if you prefer.

Thanks to Pivotal, who've provided both our venue for tonight, and the drinks.<br />
Pivotal are a consultancy and also the makers of project management tool Pivotal Tracker.<br />
I think at least some of their clients have Ruby in their technical stack, and they're probably always hiring, so go talk to Dylan to find out about any current positions.

These meetups are run under the auspices of Ruby Australia, who organise sponsorship, among other things, and make the delicious non-pizza dinner possible.<br />
So thanks to Ruby Australia and their sponsors.

# [fit] **Exercism solution**
# [fit] _Speaker Name_

---

# [fit] **_Who's_** **New?**
# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So, now if you're new to Roro, can you please put up your hand- don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you, we're going to have a 5 minute break so we can welcome them, and when we come back - we're going to have [speaker-name].

---

# [fit] **Exercism**
# [fit] *Word Count*

^
Let's now go through this month's Exercism problem, Word Count.

---

# [fit] **Next Meetup's Exercism**
# [fit] *Beer Song* :beers:
# [fit] `exercism fetch ruby beer-song`

^
The Exercism problem for next meetup is "Beer Song" in honour of Sandi Metz, who is doing a presentation at RubyConf AU in March. As well as having written the seminal Practical Object Orientated Design in Ruby, which you should absolutely all read, she has a book called 99 Bottles of OOP which is focused completely on this problem.<br />
The problem is deceptively simple: produce the lyrics to the beloved classic song 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall in Ruby. Fetch the problem from Exercism and you'll find the lyrics there, and see if you can get Ruby to sing for you.

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

---

# [fit] **_We are looking for_**
# [fit] :loudspeaker: **speakers!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of a sympathetic audience that wants you to succeed, and is all very aware of the courage that it can take to deliver a talk in front of your peers.<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, you potentially get turned into an expert in your audience's eyes.<br />
- So if you've got something to say or cool to show and tell that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...
- We won't be having a meetup in January so you've got a full 2 months to plan and create your awesome talk.

# [fit] **News**

# [fit] Ruby 2.5
# [fit] **_Released!_** :christmas_tree:

- `https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/25/ruby-2-5-0-released/`

^
- Xmas present to community etc etc

---

# [fit] Rails 5.2
# [fit] **_Released!_**

- `weblog.rubyonrails.org`

^
[I'm assuming it will be released by then... if not, this can go away]
- Main drawcard is ActiveStorage for file uploads (say goodbye to Carrierwave or Paperclip)
- Other features are a new Redis Cache store for caching all the things,
- Bootsnap in default Gemfile for faster application boot times,
- Credentials, which fuses secrets and encrypted secrets together, so that all your API keys to external services etc always get encrypted and can hence be put into version control, so I guess this might then not need gems like dotenv and Figaro...?
- Check out the Ruby on Rails blog for more details

# RubyConf
# [fit] **8-9 March 2018** **_in_** **Sydney**
# [fit] `www.rubyconf.org.au`

^
- Check the website for updates on ticket sales, but ignore any buttons there that say you can buy early bird tix because you can't!
- Standard tickets have started and they are $670, so get your boss to approve some training budget for you for this if you haven't already!
- Along with Sandi Metz, Avdi Grimm is now confirmed as coming along. So there are some seriously great guests coming along and even just these two is easily worth the price of admission for a regular ticket.
