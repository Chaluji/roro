^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.

# [fit] **We are looking for**
# [fit] SPEAKERS!
# [fit] :loudspeaker:

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of a sympathetic audience that wants you to succeed, and is all very aware of the courage that it can take to deliver a talk in front of your peers.<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, you potentially get turned into an expert in your audience's eyes.<br />
- So if you've got something to say or cool to show and tell that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

# [fit] **_Where do I sign up?_**

- :globe_with_meridians: `github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`
- _`@paulfioravanti`_
- _`@robcornish`_
- :email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo now also has 7 extra presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] **NEWS**

# [fit] **Support of Ruby 2.2**
# [fit] **_ENDED_**
# [fit] `https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/06/20/support-of-ruby-2-2-has-ended/`

^
Support of Ruby version 2.2 has now ended after being in a security maintenance phase for the last year, so if you have a project that still uses it, you are highly recommended to upgrade to Ruby 2.4 or 2.5 as soon as possible to make sure that you take advantage of all bug and security fixes to Ruby moving forward.

# [fit] Rails Asset Pipeline
# [fit] Directory Traversal Vulnerability

```rb
# config/environments/production.rb
# setting to true makes your app vulnerable
config.assets.compile = true
```

# [fit] `https://blog.heroku.com/rails-asset-pipeline-vulnerability`

^
If you compile your assets in your Rails production environment using code that looks like this, you may want to look into this Rails Asset Pipeline Directory Traversal Vulnerability as secrets contained in your repo or your environment variables have the possibility of being compromised. The fix for this is to set this flag to false, upgrade your Sprockets version, and probably also rotate any credentials you may have had stored in your app environment variables. More information about this is on Heroku's blog.

# [fit] `dry-monads 1.0` RELEASED

```rb
class Divide
  include Dry::Monads::Result::Mixin

  def call(x, y)
    if !y.zero?
      Success(x / y)
    else
      Failure(:division_by_zero)
    end
  end
end
```

# [fit] `http://dry-rb.org/news/2018/06/26/dry-monads-1-0-released/`

^
If you are a fan of the dry libraries of gems and functional programming, you may be pleased to hear that dry-monads version 1.0 has been released. So, if you want to bring some Haskell-isms into your codebase or are looking for a different way to handle errors, exceptions and method chaining, you may want to check this out.

# [fit] **FIE FRAMEWORK** ![inline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqa2i0i1psig3ii/fie-logo.png?dl=1)
# [fit] A Rails-centric frontend framework
# [fit]
# [fit] `https://fie.eranpeer.co/`

^
Finally, the Fie Framework is a project that caught my eye that looks like it may be in the same space as Basecamp's Stimulus, being a Rails-centric front-end framework that shares the state of your views with the application back-end. There are a few interesting examples of how it does this in the application documentation and showcase areas, so if this kind of thing appeals to you, go and check out Fie on the link you can see on screen. Or, even better, do a presentation about it at RORO: I've added a presentation requests for an introduction to Fie, and introduction to dry monads for anyone that's looking for presentation ideas.
