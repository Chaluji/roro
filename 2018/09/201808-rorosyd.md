If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.<br />

If you're twitter inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention rorosyd to tie the night alltogether.

# [fit] Next Meetup's Exercism
# [fit] _Leap Year_ 

Given a year, return if it's a leap year or not.

### [fit] `exercism download --exercise=leap --track=ruby`

^
Next months challenge will be Leap Year. Given a year, the program should determine if it's a leap year or not.</br>
Now over the past month there have been some major changes to Exercism. If you've logged in recently you would have noticed that all your previous complete challenge have been moved to the new site. As part of the transition, the new teams feature hasn't been rolled out yet either so at the moment we don't know what will happen to the RoRo team. I belive this will be coming soon and we'll keep you updated next month with more information.</br>
In the meantime, login to the new site, check it out, there's a real focus now on mentor feedback and you can choose it you prefer to complete the challenges independently or receive feedback before moving on to the next. </br>
As always, if you'd like to present your solution let Paul or I know and raise an issue on the RoRo github page.

# [fit] **We are always looking for**
# [fit] SPEAKERS!

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

---

# [fit] **_Where do I sign up?_**

- :globe_with_meridians: `github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`
- _`@paulfioravanti`_
- _`@robcornish`_
- :email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo has presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] `https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33079`

^
One of the new features that looks like it's making it's way to Rails 6 will be Webpacker as the default javascript complier. There's a bit of discussion around this on the PR from DHH so take a read and decide how you feel about the it.  Either way it looks like Rails 6 is getting close.
