Thanks for proposing a talk for RORO Sydney!

Please provide the following information:

- Name of talk (in the title field)
- Brief summary of the talk content
- Which month's meetup you would like to present at
- Length of talk (please try to keep to ~15 minutes, but we're happy to allow wiggle room; however, the more succinct, the better!)
- Your Twitter username (if you have one)
- Link to, or upload of, a photo of yourself that will appear in the meetup slide deck (if you don't specify one, we'll see if we can find one from your social media accounts)
