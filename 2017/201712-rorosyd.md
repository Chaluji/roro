# [fit] **Conduct**
- `ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct`

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read. If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are {list organisers} - or you can go straight to Ruby Australia if you prefer.

^
Thanks to Pivotal, who've provided both our venue for tonight, and the drinks.<br />
Pivotal are a consultancy and also the makers of project management tool Pivotal Tracker.<br />
I think at least some of their clients have Ruby in their technical stack, and they're probably always hiring, so go talk to Dylan to find out about any current positions.

These meetups are run under the auspices of Ruby Australia, who organise sponsorship, among other things, and make the delicious non-pizza dinner possible.<br />
So thanks to Ruby Australia and their sponsors.

# [fit] Say **Hello!** :wave:

^
So, now if you're new to Roro, can you please put up your hand- don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you, we're going to have a 5 minute break so we can welcome them, and when we come back - we're going to have Sam.

# [fit] **Exercism**
# [fit] *Binary*

^
Let's now go through this month's Exercism problem, Binary.

---

# [fit] **Next Meetup's Exercism**
# [fit] *Word Count*
# [fit] `exercism fetch ruby word-count`

^
The Exercism problem for next meetup is "Word Count"<br />
Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.<br />
It's deceptively simple, and you might just learn a few new string manipulation tricks!

---

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

---

# [fit] **_We are looking for_**
# [fit] :loudspeaker: **speakers!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of a sympathetic audience that wants you to succeed, and is all very aware of the courage that it can take to deliver a talk in front of your peers.<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, you potentially get turned into an expert in your audience's eyes.<br />
- So if you've got something to say or cool to show and tell that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...
- We won't be having a meetup in January so you've got a full 2 months to plan and create your awesome talk.

# [fit] **_Where do I_** **sign up?**

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting to do more...

# [fit] **News**

---

# [fit] Rails 5.2 Beta
# [fit] **_Released!_**

- `weblog.rubyonrails.org`

^
- Main drawcard is ActiveStorage for file uploads (say goodbye to Carrierwave or Paperclip)
- Other features are a new Redis Cache store for caching all the things,
- Bootsnap in default Gemfile for faster application boot times,
- Credentials, which fuses secrets and encrypted secrets together, so that all your API keys to external services etc always get encrypted and can hence be put into version control, so I guess this might then not need gems like dotenv and Figaro...?
- Check out the Ruby on Rails blog for more details

---

# [fit] **RubyConf 2017**
# [fit] *videos* Online!

- `confreaks.tv/events/rubyconf2017`
- `youtube.com/user/Confreaks`

^
If you missed being able to get to New Orleans for RubyConf this year, which I assume is everyone in this room (did anyone actually go?), you can see all the talks either directly at confreaks.tv or on the Confreaks YouTube channel.

# [fit] `www.rubyconf.org.au`

^
- Check the website for updates on ticket sales, but ignore any buttons there that say you can buy early bird tix because you can't!
- Standard tickets have started and they are $670, so get your boss to approve some training budget for you for this if you haven't already!

^
- Along with Sandi Metz, Avdi Grimm is now confirmed as coming along. So there are some seriously great guests coming along and even just these two is easily worth the price of admission for a regular ticket.

- Exercism: it's like programmer crack and awesome fun (I thought I'd do some so we could get an idea in advance about what exercises to set for RORO, but I ended up doing more than 30 in the last month and can't seem to stop). Good thing is that I'm going to put a link to them on my resume as code examples because why not?
- Mastering Ruby Closures by Benjamin Tan Wei Hao, available at the Pragmatic Bookshelf. A short (< 100 pages), but succinct guide to Procs, blocks, lambdas, aka anonymous functions in Ruby.

Please make sure to clean up after yourself and put your plates in the rubbish bins and empty bottles on the far table (not the recycling bins as they end up getting too heavy)<br />
Please feel free to continue the conversations at the pub or at gelato but **you can't stay here**, so please move on to your venue of choice as soon as you can.<br />
Have an awesome end of year break, and look forward to seeing you again next year!
