If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read. If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are {list organisers} - or you can go straight to Ruby Australia if you prefer.

^
Thanks to Pivotal, who've provided both our venue for tonight, and the drinks.<br />
Pivotal are a consultancy and also the makers of project management tool Pivotal Tracker.<br />
I think at least some of their clients have Ruby in their technical stack, and they're probably always hiring, so go talk to Dylan to find out about any current positions.

These meetups are run under the auspices of Ruby Australia, who organise sponsorship, among other things, and make the delicious non-pizza dinner possible.<br />
So thanks to Ruby Australia and their sponsors.

So, now if you're new to Roro, can you please put up your hand- don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.
Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you, we're going to have a 5 minute break so we can welcome them, and when we come back - we're going to have Tarun

# [fit] **_Thank you!_**
# [fit] `Â \o/`

Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

---

# [fit] **We are looking for**
# [fit] **_speakers!_**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of a sympathetic audience that wants you to succeed, and is all very aware of the courage that it can take to deliver a talk in front of your peers.<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, you potentially get turned into an expert in your audience's eyes.<br />
- So if you've got something to say or cool to show and tell that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

# [fit] **_Where do I_** **sign up?**

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting to do more...
