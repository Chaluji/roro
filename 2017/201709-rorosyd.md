^
If this is your first Roro, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia's events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read. If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are {list organisers} - or you can go straight to Ruby Australia if you prefer.
