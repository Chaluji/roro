We'd love to have you speak, or suggest a talk for Sydney Ruby. In addition to your talk topic, please mention the following:

- Is this a proposal (you want to give this talk yourself) or a request (you'd like someone else to give this talk)?
- Intended audience (beginners, intermediates, advanced)

For proposals:
- Which month would you be ready for?
- Is this a 5m (lightning) talk, or a 15m talk?
