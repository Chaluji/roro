We'd love to have you speak, or suggest a talk for Sydney Ruby. If you can let us know the info below, it makes our lives easier:

-[] Is this a proposal (you want to give this talk yourself) or a request (you'd like someone else to give this talk)?
-[] Who is the intended audience (beginners, intermediates, advanced, everyone?)
-[] Which month would you like to give this talk?
